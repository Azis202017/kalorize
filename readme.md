## Technology Stack
- **TensorFlow**: The primary machine learning framework.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Offers the infrastructure for hosting, scalability, and performance.
- **Cloud Run**: A serverless platform on GCP for hosting the application, featuring auto-scaling and simplified deployments.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the application.

## Docker Container
The application is containerized using Docker, facilitating easy deployment and scalability. The Docker container can be pulled and run with the necessary environment setup, abstracting complexities and ensuring a consistent runtime environment.

*Note:* The 'Food Dataset' used in this application is not available in the GitHub repository due to confidentiality constraints. For more information, please contact us.
